# About Me

Hello! My name is Wilson Wongso, a sophomore Computer Science student currently studying in Bina Nusantara University. My main field of interest is **Deep Learning**, especially solving problems related to Computer Vision and Natural Language.

Aside from programming, I am mainly an esports content writer at [Hybrid Indonesia](https://hybrid.co.id/) where I discuss competitive gaming, professional players & teams, do interviews, and occasionally mix a little machine learning in my writing. In my free time, I tutor high school students privately and host a podcast show together with my friends at [Podcast Keren](https://open.spotify.com/show/6gzT06081Q7TFJAeYUdnfK?si=F65NpD6bR6izeJh65fV2aw&dl_branch=1).
