Hello! My name is Wilson Wongso, a Machine Learning Engineer who just started his PhD at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Sydney, üá¶üá∫ Australia. My fields of interest include low-resource Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech Language Processing (SLP).

On the side, I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Bookbot](https://www.bookbotkids.com/). I lead a small team of two and our work focuses on automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, audio classification, conversational AI, and many more.

I am also an independent researcher at [Lazarus NLP](https://lazarusnlp.github.io/). We work on open-source language models for languages of üáÆüá© Indonesia. Our main goal is to revive the dying languages of Indonesia through speech and language technology. Our most recent publication is titled [NusaBERT: Teaching IndoBERT to be Multilingual and Multicultural](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01817).

Before all of this, I was mainly an esports content writer at [Hybrid Indonesia](https://hybrid.co.id/) where I discuss competitive gaming, professional players & teams, do interviews, and occasionally mix a little machine learning in my writing. You can view my articles on [Notion](https://w11wo.notion.site/ebd6b1a72b364378aaeacbe7732ae2db?v=e3c7bdea1ff64328b9a89d55abe85260).

<br>
Our team at <a href="https://www.bookbotkids.com/">Bookbot</a> is currently developing a grapheme-to-phoneme Python package for Bahasa Indonesia. The package is highly inspired by its English counterpart, <a href="https://github.com/Kyubyong/g2p">g2p</a>. A lot of our design and methods are borrowed from that library, most notably the steps to predict phonemes.

<br>
As I enter my freshman year in university, I‚Äôm gradually exposed to more people and their various backgrounds. The more I chat with my new friends, the more I get to understand one major difference that I‚Äôve overlooked all this time ‚Äì a school‚Äôs curriculum.

<br>
While a lot of people abroad are racing to read hundreds of books per year, the Indonesian people are famous for having one of the world‚Äôs lowest reading interests. This peculiarity is not only concerning to many but also represents a huge irony for a country whose people are immensely active in day-to-day social media activities.

Like many young kids growing up, I hated mathematics. The subject to me seemed blurry, scary, full of large quantities, and looked like I could never catch up to my peers who were excelling in elementary school. More often than not, I will also hear a couple of my schoolmates who argued that this subject is utterly useless in the real world, their most favorite catchphrase being: ‚Äúwhy do we even study this?‚Äù

After weeks of preparation, quarantine session, and a great show of team fighting skills, the M2 World Championship has finally come to an end, crowning the latest, world‚Äôs best team in Mobile Legends Bang Bang. More importantly, M2 marks the end of an era for multiple recurring themes, ranging from the newly crowned champions to those who retired with a quite bitter aftertaste.

<br>
Esports is one of the most attractive and popular fields to hop into in recent years. It has proven its worth and the amount of attention it gets even from the mainstream public. To a few, esports is merely forming teams and playing as five, but it gets more serious than that. Esports has formed its very own ecosystem outside of casual gaming, and the two realms seem to be growing in their own separate ways.

<br>
When we think of esports athletes, we tend to think of relatively older players who either have dropped out of school to chase their dreams or be semi-responsible for their academic lives. More often than not, it‚Äôs tempting to play games over doing homework, since most of us probably dislike the idea of not having fun.
